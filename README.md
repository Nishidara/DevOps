# DevOps

Popeye - We had to containerize and define the deployment of a simple web poll application and create 3 images.
The specifications for each image were described in our document that I cannot share.

Chocolatine - In this project, we had to setup a GitHub Actions workflow to enforce good practices and diverse rules in a
repository, our workflow must be usable with our different Epitech projects and their respective technologies and
associated tools.
There were different JOBS that it mush do, like :
checking the coding style, checking that the program compiles correctly, running test (BECAUSE THATâ€™S WHAT HEROES DO) and pushing to the mirror repository.
